Abihud's Basic Addition-only Calculator

This is a simple Python program that performs **addition only** based on user input.

 How It Works

1. Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
2. Prompts the user to enter an operation (currently supports **only addition** using `+`).
3. Adds the two numbers if the operation is valid and displays the result.
4. Displays an error message if any operation other than `+` is entered.
