# CORD-19 Research Analysis Project

This project provides a comprehensive analysis and an interactive dashboard for the CORD-19 dataset, which contains a large collection of research papers on COVID-19.

## Features

*   **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Scripts to clean and prepare the CORD-19 metadata for analysis.
*   **In-depth Analysis**: Performs analysis on publication trends, top journals, and common research themes.
*   **Interactive Dashboard**: A Streamlit application to visually explore the data with interactive filters.
*   **Visualizations**: Generates various plots like publications over time, top journals, and word clouds.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   pip

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abihud254/PythonPLP.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd PythonPLP/wk8/Project
    ```
3.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn streamlit wordcloud
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Analysis

To run the data analysis and generate the visualizations, execute the following command:

```bash
python cord19_analysis.py
```

This will process the data and save the generated plots as PNG files in the project directory.

### Launching the Dashboard

To launch the interactive Streamlit dashboard, run:

```bash
streamlit run cord19_dashboard.py
```

This will open the dashboard in your web browser.
